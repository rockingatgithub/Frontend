        intro: `
The traditionally technology-centered medical devices industry is witnessing a paradigm shift with the increasing consumerization of healthcare. Medical devices that were typically designed for clinicians and surgeons today must address hospital and insurance firm requirements as well. While developed markets grapple with more stringent regulations and the need to align to value-based care, the emerging economies demand locally relevant products. Besides, the adoption of advanced technologies such as artificial intelligence, cloud, and IoT has the power to democratize healthcare in addition to making it more precise, personalized, and cost-effective. To stay ahead of the curve in this dynamic business landscape, MedTech firms need to embrace an innovative approach to design and development.

At Ogive, we have supported our global medtech clients to switch to a more user-centered design, enhance product features, be cost-competitive, comply with geography-specific regulatory landscape, and launch products within stipulated timelines.
