    description: `
Facial recognition is a way of recognizing a human face through technology. A facial recognition system aided with Artificial Intelligence algorithms maps facial features from a live camera feed or photograph or a video. It compares the information with a database of known faces to find a match.

How PEHCHAAN works.
<ul class="ul arrow-light p-r-32 p-l-32">
    <li class="li body-regular">Step 1: A picture of your face is captured from a live camera feed/photo/video. Your face might appear alone or in a crowd. Your image may show you looking straight ahead or nearly in profile.</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Step 2: Our AI based facial recognition software reads the geometry of your face. Key factors include the distance between eyes and the distance from forehead to chin. The software identifies facial landmarks - one system identifies 68 of them  - that are key to distinguishing the face. The result: facial signature.</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Your facial signature - a mathematical formula - is compared to a database of known faces.</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">A determination is made. your face print may match that of an image in a facial recognition system database.</li>
</ul>

Facial recognition System integrated with RFID and Biometric system
<ul class="ul arrow-light p-r-32 p-l-32">
    <li class="li body-regular">We have seen the perks of Facial recognition system, in order to make it more secure and robust we have integrated it with RFID/Biometrics.</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">These systems can be used for verification of employees in an office/police department/to provide authorised access/attendance monitoring/identification</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">A person has to swipe his card against the reader then image will be fetched from the database and image verification will be done. Similarly the same process can also be performed by replacing RFID reader/tag system with biometric access.</li>
</ul>

Advantages:
<ul class="ul arrow-light p-r-32 p-l-32">
    <li class="li body-regular">Facial recognition technology provides verification that is authenticated, convenient, quick, and accurate.</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Since facial recognition technology is automated, it also reduces the need for security guards to personally verify a match. This means businesses can save costs on hiring security staff and other security measures.</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Database could be maintained for records to be accessed as needed</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">No need to maintain books making this an eco-friendly option</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Visitors could be Categorised as required</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Can be implemented with existing CCTV infrastructure</li>
    <li class="li body-regular">Voice, Video & integrated Data Systems</li>
</ul>
