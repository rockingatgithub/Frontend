In any user site, equipment failure can impact the entire operation and result in costly unplanned downtime. <br/><br/>
In addition, remote data collection alleviates the need for manual measurement and inspection of equipment, which often creates unsafe working conditions for user operators. By mitigating inaccurate manual data collection, equipment failure and damage to peripheral equipment can be avoided – and at times the mechanical life of the equipment can even be extended.
<br/><br/>
By pulling together previously disparate condition data from various assets, such as valves, switches, sensors, motors, switchgear, gearboxes, crushers and conveyors to collectively analyse and compare all data, Ogive is able to provide forewarning of a potential fault with a proposed solution - all with enough time to address it before production is affected.
