Simulators for various systems (we are certified production agency) for a specified class of simulators. <br/><br/>

Virtual reality comes in many forms. Current versions involve viewing a virtual world inside a head mounted display (HMD) shutting out the real world. If you can still see your immediate surroundings, that’s augmented reality – a subject for another article. The virtual world might be a computer-generated 3D environment or a 360 video.

Before committing to a costly investment in an uncertain solution to increase productivity or for smooth planning with data capture, any unit may want to seek or understand the advantages of the proposed solution.
<br /><br />
One of our product is Aircraft maintenance simulation through VR is a disruptive solution proposed by OGIVE for a first-hand experience of any aircraft. We build to the aircraft and it’s components in 3D using the architectural designs. To provide an immersive and interactive view for identifying the parts and practicing maintenance, we take the user into this virtual environment and allow him to get a hands on experience in a realistic manner.
